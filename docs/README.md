## Welcome to CrapMaps

CrapMaps is an innovative solution to the universal problem that arose from the phenomena of public bathrooms: worry.

When you go to a public bathroom, you could be in discomfort in a place made to comfort you! Sometimes parents may need to change a diaper but it unknown whether the bathroom has a baby changing station. Parents already deal with crap everday so they don't need to deal with this shit. So CrapMaps allows you to plan ahead.

### Revolutionary Idea

CrapMaps allows people to see reviews of the public restrooms near them, along with the features the washcloset does or does not have.

Cleanliness minded and want to check if there is warm/hot water, automatic sink and/or soap dispenser and/or towel dispenser (if it's not an air dryer), and even if there is a trash can by the door so you won't need to touch the handle.

All this information a tap away.
